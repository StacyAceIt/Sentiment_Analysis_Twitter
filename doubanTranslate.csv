45,"2.5 虽然我在“年度最期待”之下，的确对它大失所望，但要指出：它不只是简单的跨阶层童话或意淫，更像是套浪漫爱情包装的新时代黑人剥削片(转黄人)衍生的讽刺喜剧(类似超低配乔丹·皮尔)。当然啦，和绝大部分黑人喜剧比，《摘金》是软糯的——它没那么尖酸刻薄，而是很轻飘地做一些表达，整体蛮顺畅也蛮好看的，可以给及格分。
所以也不大赞同说《摘金》只是片面“东方学意淫”的说法，它虽然有着小妞电影自古有之的类型缺陷，但还是体现出了不同华人移民各自阶层、文化碰撞后的裂痕与弥合，并带有较少(但好歹还是有一点)的讽刺性。但大家还是很容易，去骂“出头(已不易)的电影”吧。

114,讲真我看剧本的时候觉得这故事写的蛮好玩儿的，但没想到成片出来会这么造作，仿佛所有人都不会演戏。朱浩伟像个找不到节奏的DJ，带一群演员在舞池里卖力尬舞。而且令我费解的是，剧本的结尾有一场很重要的阳台对话戏被删掉了。母亲棒打鸳鸯后，男主是有一段情感爆发的，他怪母亲把年幼的自己送给阿嬷抚养，为了家族的未来而牺牲了他；而母亲认为这是值得的，过去的牺牲给儿子换来了今天的一切，她替儿子做了她认为最好的选择。这段对话阐明了母亲的价值观，也为她最终同意儿媳进门做了解释，因为她觉得自己不能再替儿子的人生做选择，不能再一次牺牲儿子的幸福。这样给剧本画圆的段落，正片居然给剪了？？实在有点想不明白。,0.0,"When I read the script, I thought it was a very playful story, but I didn't expect it to be so contrived in pieces, as if everyone wouldn't act.

The dialog play was deleted. After the mother stick hit the Mandarin duck, the male owner has an emotional outburst, he blames the mother to give his young self to Grandma to raise, for the sake of the future of the family and sacrifice him; and the mother thought it was worth it, and the sacrifice of the past gave her son what she thought was the best choice for her son. The dialogue elucidated the mother's values and explained her eventual consent to her daughter-in-law's entry, as she felt she could no longer make choices for her son's life and could not sacrifice her son's happiness again.
